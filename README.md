# Bulldozer Price Regression Project

## Overview
This project focuses on developing and evaluating a Machine Learning model to predict bulldozer sale prices. The dataset consists of historical sales data, which includes features such as equipment type, sale dates, and geographic information. The goal is to create a model that provides reliable price predictions to assist buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

## Technologies Used
* **Python** (for building the machine learning model)
* **Pandas** (for data manipulation and analysis)
* **NumPy** (for numerical operations)
* **Scikit-learn** (for building and evaluating the machine learning model)
* **Matplotlib** (for data visualization)

## Dataset
The project uses the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers dataset. The dataset consists of historical data on bulldozer sales, including features like machine type, year of manufacture, and sale price.

### How to Access the Dataset
Unfortunately, the dataset is too large to be uploaded to GitHub. To use the data for this project, you must download it from Kaggle:

1. Visit the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers dataset page: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data).
2. Download the dataset as `.csv` files.
3. Place the dataset in the `data` folder within the project directory.

## Source
This project is based on a hands-on learning experience from the **Complete A.I. & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp** by **Zero To Mastery Academy**. The course provided a structured approach to mastering data science and machine learning techniques, which were applied to complete this project.
